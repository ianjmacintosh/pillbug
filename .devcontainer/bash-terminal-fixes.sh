# and renders Unicode characters correctly.
# Upstream now sets LANG=C.UTF-8 in the base image itself
# (devcontainers/images#1926), but the floating :24 tag hadn't picked that up
# as of 2026-07-28. Safe to drop this export once it has.

# a direct docker exec), fall back to xterm-256color so programs don't see an
# unknown TERM and degrade their output.
